name: product-ui-direction
description: >-
  Turn a fuzzy product brief into a concrete UI direction before implementation. Use when the product,
  feature, app screen, dashboard, or landing page needs a clear category, operating mode, interface
  pattern, style family, palette direction, typography character, interaction intensity, anti-patterns,
  and delivery checklist. Complements `frontend-design` by choosing the right product direction before
  art direction and execution.

# Product UI Direction

Use this skill when the hard question is not "how do I code this?" but "what kind of interface should this product become?"

This skill complements `frontend-design`:

- `product-ui-direction` decides product fit, operating mode, UI pattern, style family, and anti-patterns
- `frontend-design` executes the chosen direction with strong composition and motion

Skip this skill for pure backend work, non-visual automation, infrastructure tasks, or performance work that does not change how the interface looks, feels, moves, or is used.

## Output

Produce a compact but complete UI direction with:

1. product category
2. product mode
3. primary pattern
4. supporting sections or surface areas
5. style family
6. color direction
7. typography direction
8. interaction and motion intensity
9. anti-patterns
10. pre-delivery checklist

## Workflow

1. Classify the product with `references/product-categories.md`.
2. Decide the operating mode with `references/product-modes.md`.
3. Choose the right pattern with `references/pattern-families.md`.
4. Pick a style family with `references/style-families.md`.
5. Set palette and typography direction from product mood, trust level, and content density, not trend bias.
6. Set motion intensity from the core job: conversion, scanning, exploration, creation, or data work.
7. List anti-patterns specific to the domain.
8. End with a concrete implementation brief the execution skill can follow.

## Product Modes

- **High-trust**: banking, healthcare, legal, security, government. Bias to clarity, credibility, calm hierarchy, explicit affordances.
- **Operational**: dashboards, admin, analytics, internal tools. Bias to scanability, density, utility copy, durable structure.
- **Expressive**: creative tools, media, music, fashion, lifestyle. Bias to stronger visual identity, but keep one clear operating model.
- **Editorial**: publishing, storytelling, brand campaigns, portfolios. Bias to rhythm, pacing, image treatment, typography voice.
- **Conversion**: signup, booking, purchase, waitlist, lead capture, contact sales. Bias to focused hierarchy, persuasive copy, clear primary action, minimal distraction.
- **Creation**: editors, builders, design tools, content tools, AI generation surfaces. Bias to direct manipulation of an artifact, responsive feedback, low-friction controls.

If two modes seem valid, choose the one that governs the user's main job, then borrow carefully from the second.

## Deliverable Shape

Write the result in this structure:

- Product category
- Product mode
- Primary pattern
- Suggested section order or surface layout
- Style family
- Color direction
- Typography direction
- Motion direction
- Anti-patterns to avoid
- Delivery checklist

## Guardrails

- Do not jump straight to colors or fonts before deciding operating mode and pattern.
- Do not recommend the same style family for every product type.
- High-trust products should not look like experimental AI demos.
- Operational tools should not be dressed like marketing landing pages.
- Expressive products can push identity harder, but still need usability and hierarchy.
- Anti-patterns are mandatory output, not optional garnish.
- Use real product surfaces, screenshots, data, or examples when the execution phase needs visual proof.
- Keep motion purposeful: state changes, continuity, feedback, or guided discovery. Avoid decorative animation that slows the task.
- Delivery checklists must include accessibility, responsive behavior, interaction states, and reduced-motion expectations.
